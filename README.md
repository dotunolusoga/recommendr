# recommendr
A book recommendation app - An interactive Ruby Command Line Application

# Project Vision

This will be a command line program that asks a user about the weather, their mood etc and uses this information to recommend a book that's intended to change their mood(not always for the better), as well give witty puns, insults or sayings.
